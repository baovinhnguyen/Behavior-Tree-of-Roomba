# Behavior-Tree-of-Roomba-Vaccuum

The project is to simulate the behavior tree of a Roomba vaccuum. The Roomba always charges battery first. If the battery level is below 30%, it will go to "Home" to charge. If the battery meets the sufficient level, it performs the commands. There are three commands, which are Spot cleaning, General cleaning, and Do nothing. For Spot cleaning, the Roomba will perform a 20s intensive cleaning in a particular area. For General cleaning, the Roomba will go around and clean until its battery falls under 30%. My submission achieved 100/ 100 score.
